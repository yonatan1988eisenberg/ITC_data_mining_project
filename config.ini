[PARSER]
description = This program helps the user navigate through metacritic.com/game
              to a search page. It does so by getting input from user on
              available search parameters such as platform, dates etc.
              This program can be run in two modes:
              1. manually (when search_code is not provided)
              2. automatically When the program is run manually it will help the
              user find the search page he is looking for by prompting available
              options.
              In auto-mode the user knows which search page is he looking for
              and knows the code to get there. If the code is unknown run the
              program manually and the search code is the concatenation of your
              input.
              usage in auto-mode: [program_name] [options]

sc_help = a sting of ints indicating the search page the user wishes to scrape. if the search
          code is too long the program will use its first n digits. If not provided the program
          will run on manual mode.

f_help = int; the number of articles to fetch from the search page. default is 100. Can be used
         only in combination with search_code.

a_help = bool; some search pages allow to sort the results ascending. if a code to such a
         search page was used asc can be chosen as True. default is False. Can be used only
         in combination with search_code.
