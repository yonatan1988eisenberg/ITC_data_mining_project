## Acknowledgements

## FAQ

#### How does one use your program?

One simply runs main.py and is prompted to answer some questions.
Answer the questions by typing the required numbers. 
These will help narrow down the users search to the exact type
of games to which he is interested in gathering information about?

#### Why does it take longer then usual?

We implemented a sleep function to ensure the program runs smoothly.
This has increased the total running time.
